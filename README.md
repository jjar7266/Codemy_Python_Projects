# Codemy.com — Python Projects Collection
### All projects completed while following John Elder’s Codemy.com Python courses

This repository contains a complete collection of the Python projects I built while following various Codemy.com tutorials.  
Each project is recreated step‑by‑step with clean structure, improved readability, and supporting files exactly as used in the original lessons.

## What’s Inside
- Individual project folders and standalone scripts  
- Supporting files such as word lists, JSON dictionaries, and data resources  
- Clean, organized code reflecting each lesson’s goals  
- Small apps, utilities, and hands‑on practice exercises  
- A consistent layout for easy navigation and reference  

## Project Types
- GUI mini‑apps  
- Word and text utilities  
- File‑based tools and small automation scripts  
- Beginner‑friendly games  
- Practice exercises reinforcing Python fundamentals  

## Purpose
This repo serves as a personal archive of my Codemy.com project work.  
All code is written by **Jose “Joe” Ruiz**, following the tutorials while improving clarity, structure, and maintainability.

## Notes
This repository is for educational use only and follows along with the Codemy.com curriculum.
